<h3>The magical Fruit tree</h3>
    <p>Walking into the kitchen a little dog is trying  to open the fridge door. I opened the door for it and watched as it scrambled onto the bottom shelf. It looked around for a second before excitingly wagged its tail finding the desired item. It pushed the container out onto the floor, then looked up at me expectantly, waiting for me to open it. I bent down and picked up the container and taking out a plate from the cabin. Placing both items on the counter I started to open the container. The pup hopped up on the counter and started running on the counter towards the container. Opening the jar was a struggle, I spent a good 10 minutes struggling with the lid, until it finally came off. The pup sat there patiently waiting with its head tilted, it sat up and walked over and started licking me hand. I giggled as I put the lid to the side and poured the contents into the plate. The pup let out a happy bark and started eating the contents on the plate happily. I put the lid back onto the jar, then placed the container back into the frig. I turned around to the pup who was peacefully eating his food and just enjoy the silence. I was about to start breakfast when I heard an alarm go off from upstairs. The pup jumped off the counter and ran up the stairs to the alarm. I hurried after it, stumbling up the stairs. I went to the door where the alarm was going off and saw the pup wagging its tail excitedly. I walked past the bed, where someone was sleeping, to a window and opened the curtains. I heard a groan come from the bed and the figure from the bed mumbled something that I couldn‚Äôt hear. I approached the bed and prepared to sneak attack the figure. I waited for a couple minutes waiting to see if the figure would wake up but it didn‚Äôt. I jumped onto the figure, and pulled off the covers shouting "WAKE UUUP!!!". The figure bolted up straight smacking our heads together in the process. "Owww..." said Almond as he rubbed his forehead. "Why did you do that Opal?!". ‚ÄúBeecccaauuuseeeee why not‚Äù Opal laughed at almonds reaction. "That's not a valid reason Opal." Almond said with a smile. ‚ÄúWell it is now Almond!‚Äù Opal said with a victorious Smile. "Alright. Then I can do.... THIS?!" Almond said smirking as he threw a pillow straight into Opal's face. Opal got off the bed and walked to the door bending down to pick up the pup who was watching them curiously. "Join us downstairs when your Ready, Frostbite and I will prepare some food." Opal said as she walked out of the room. Before she walked down the stairs she quickly ran back into the room and threw frostbite on almond who started attacking his face. "OPAAAALLLLLL!!! WHYYYY" Almond yelled threw Frostbite's fur. ‚ÄúBecause you threw a pillow!‚Äù Opal yelled running out of the door. Almond groaned as he pulled the ball of fur from his face and got out of bed. Frostbite followed almond to the kitchen where he started to help Opal make breakfast for the 3 of them. One big mess, tons of laughter, and a long cleanup later the three of them sat on the couch. They were eating breakfast and planning what they would do for the day when frostbite let out a bark and attempted to draw something with his mouth. It dragged a marker across a paper slowly making a word. The word was hard to read but after some time looking at it Opal said ‚Äúfrostbite is it a magical fruit tree?‚Äù. Frostbite barked in reply, happily running in a circle. Before they left to find the magical fruit tree they packed a picnic basket full of food for the adventure. Almond put the basket into his bag, as well as a few other supplies, and they headed out. It was a nice day out for an adventure and they followed frostbite into the nearby forest.  Little critters could be heard all around, as well as the leaves rustling in the treetops above.  Light shined through the leaves of the trees as they continued to follow frostbite threw the forest. The woods grew quiet as the walked further into the trees, and soon only the sound of leaves crunching and twigs snapping could be heard. "I‚Äôve been thinking " Almond started but was interrupted by frostbites bark up ahead. Almond and Opal hurried to catch up with Frostbite. When they caught up to frostbite they were in a clearing with a massive tree looming above them. "Whoa.." Almond and Opal said in unison as they stared in awe at the tree. Frostbite ran to the tree and picked up something with his mouth and ran back to opal and almond. Almond bent down to retrieve the object from the pup and held it up so Opal could see it. In his hand was one of the most shiniest apples they have ever seen before and they could have seen sparkles coming off the apple when held to the sun. Almond and Opal starred in completely awe at the magical fruit, than back at Frostbite wondering how it knew of this tree. Frostbite just looked happily at them waiting for them to set up the picnic. Almond and Opal looked at Frostbite and realized what it wanted, and Almond started to unpack. Almond set up the picnic and went to get some fruit for the 3 of them to eat. Meanwhile Opal and Frostbite played in the shade of the tree and threw leaves at each other. Almond brought back a ton of shiny fruits and cut them up and took out a bowl from his bag and put all the fruits in the bowl. After eating yummy fruit salad they decided to investigate the tree. Almond took out a apple camera and took a picture of the magical fruit tree with frostbite running towards it. Then Almond and Opal raced to the trunk, loser had to do the dishes. "I shall never lose!!" Almond yelled while getting close to the tree and slipped on a banana. Almond's feet swung out from beneath him making him land with a thud on the ground. "Owwwww" Almond painfully said as Opal and frostbite ran past him towards the Tree. Opal touched the tree exclaiming "I did it!! Woooo!! No dishes!" while spinning facing away from the tree. "Yay! Dishes I love dishes" Almond yelled sarcastically as he dusted himself Off. "Sorry, but I've been doing them the past week because I keep losing. I don't want to do today, or tomorrow." Opal said with a smirk "Maybe frostbite can help you." Frostbite let out a unhappy bark and walked away to take a nap under the tree. Almond started walking towards Opal, when he got close he sprinted tackling Opal. Almond and opal fell onto the ground with almond on top with opal on the bottom. "Allmmmooonnndddd!! Why??!" Opal Said "Opaaaaaaaaaaallllllll!!!! Better help me on some of the dishes" Almond offered while pinning opal more onto the ground "Nu" Opal said "Never!" "Well then opal we could stay here all day long until you agree to help me" Almond said smiling. "Nu" Opal said, determined not to give in. "Nu? The only way for us to leave is for you to agree to help me in the meantime does you wanna play a game?" Almond offered. "A game?" Opal asked smiling "I thought I couldn't move." " You can't move." Almond replied confusingly " I thought maybe we could play a game where we could just talk?" "Okie then, I don't plan on giving in though." Opal said still smiling "Well maybe we could just ask each other questions to try and remember who we are?" Almond asked smiling back at opal "Hmm, okie. Sounds good!" Opal Agreed "Well maybe we could just ask each other questions to try and remember who we are?" Almond asked smiling back at opal "Hmm, okie. Sounds good!" Opal Agreed "Is that your question? Nu I don't want to do the dishes." Opal said "I'm determined not to do them, you can't make me." "Sowy sowy almond apologized I'll stop asking" Almond apologized "Do you remember anything from before we met?" "It's okie, are you going to move? Or we going to stay on the grass until it's dark." Opal giggled "And, I only remember part of my past." "Nah I'm comfortable here" Almond stubbornly said while giving opal a smile "I don't remember a lot too just some random memories." Opal smiled "Okie then. My turn?" "Yup it is!" Almond Smiled "Hmmmm... What's one moment you can remember?" Opal asked Almond thought about this for a second "I remember I used to spend time walking in the woods alone and found a place that overlooked a lake, which was my personal spot." Opal looked thoughtful for a second before asking "Was the lake shaped like a crescent moon?"  Almond had a look of realization "when you think about it does look like a crescent moon!" Opal face lit up "No way!! I lived right by it!!" "You did!? No way I can't believe that!" Almonds face lit up Too "What if we met near there!" Opal said excitedly "We could have I spent tons of time around there so we must've had met" Almond got excited too. Opal closed her eyes, deep in thought before opening them and saying "I remember something!!!" "You do!?" Almond got weally excited and started to shake opal on the ground. "Aaaah Almooommmddd!! Stoooopp iiitttt" Opal said "I'm so sowy I got too excited" Almond sheepishly Smiled Opal rolled her eyes while smiling "Your turn." "What did you remember" Almond was still curious about what opal had to say. "What did you remember" Almond was still curious about what opal had to say. "I'll tell you later, when you get off me." Opal said smirking, knowing it was going to be a while. "Hmmmmmm tempting offer I have a counter off" Almond argued "How about you agree to help me on the dishes?" "I'm good." Opal said smiling "It's still your turn, whenever your ready." "Darn I thought I had you there" Almond said defeated "Anything you remember doing at the lake?" Opal giggled "I'm not giving in anytime soon." She paused to think "Not much, swimming, picnics, sailing, and flying." "Flying?" Almond asked "Yup! My familiar Amber and I loved flying over the lake together." Opal enthusiastically  ‚ÄúUmmmmmmm opal? I don‚Äôt think anyone could fly." Almond confusing said. "But that sounds like a lot of fun! I only read, day dreamed, had fun with my dog, and fished.‚Äù "No silly, I wasn't flying." Opal giggled "I was on Amber's back, she's a unicorn with wings. Oooo that sounds like lots of fun!!!" "Woah! No way!! I wonder how I never saw a flying unicorn before?" "Hmm maybe! I don't think I've ever seen you near the lake." "My spot was hidden it was under a tree and surrounded by bushes so you might have not seen me" "Oooooo that sounds vewy secretive and cozy!" "It was!! I brought some blankets and made a fire pit so I coulds make food!!" Almond face lit up talking about his little Space "That sounds amazing!!" Opal said while imagining the comfortable space "I was planning to hang some lights but didn't know how I was going to light it." Almond smiled remembering his plan to hang the lights up. ‚ÄúWhat if you used fairy lights?! Oooo or fireflies!!!‚Äù Opal exclaimed .... To be continued
